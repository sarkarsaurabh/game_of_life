# Game of Life
___________________________

Change brings opportunities. Change, sometimes, is the only way to survive, let alone thrive. In this small simulated game of life, you will see how changes in one's willingless and ability to adapt to changes in life opens up to new resources, opportunies, and chances to prosper in life.    


Background story: 

This is a small world of tiny robots, named The Kingdom of Gearminds. The robots live on cheese, specifically Swiss Cheese (for no better reason than "why not"), and for the love of that delicious awesomeness, they work all day long searching for cheese without rest. The tiny creatures are simple beings with limited vision. If they find cheese, they pick it up and head home, leaving a trail of cheese crumbs for its fellows to follow. 

Where is the shiny button: 

As the master of the game you can influence the robots to be more receptive to change by using the slider on the bottom. Further you move the slider right more adventurous the robots become and they tend to explore for greener grounds. 

If you keep the slider towards left, you would the see how the robots keep following the old trails even when the cheese is all gone on the other hand keep to too much to the right and robots break into anarchy and dont like to follow trails.
